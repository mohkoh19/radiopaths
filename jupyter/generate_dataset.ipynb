The table `study_list` contains a list of all patients and studies with their respective reports (as relative paths). The table `record_list` is analogue to `study_list`, while containing related X-Ray images instead of reports (again as relative pahts). Note that the same patient can have multiple different images for the same study, due to multiple view positions. Lastly, the `dicom_meta_string` table contains  meta information for each image. In particular, we are interested in the timing of the studies to select appropriate covariates in later steps, and the view position of the image. \n",

Our task is to classify `Pneumonia`, but we want to make our classifier robust agains ambiguities between similar visual features of different diseases.

    "An issue with the chexpert-labeler (and other NLP tools for label extraction) is the huge amount of uncertain and missing labels, which reduces the amount of data we can use significantly. Just substituting those labels with negative or positive ones could lead to a substantial increase in false negative rates and corrupt or bias subsequent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the paper, we try to fill uncertain or missing labels in our preprocessing by using the available ICD-9 and ICD-10 ontologies from `diagnoses_icd` and `d_icd_diagnoses` tables from `mimic_hosp`. This approach is only possible for diseases that can be described with ICD-codes, not for mere findings in the radiograph images. ICD codes can only be identified by the `subject_id` and `hadm_id` of the respective patients. We have no information about the time of a diagnosis, but only a list of all diagnoses per stay in the hospital. Thus we can't use the ICD codes to determine positive labels and are also limited in determining negative labels i.e. we can only globally derive labels for the whole hospitalization and not for each study during the same hospitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunatly, we don't have the `hadm_id` for the CXR studies. In fact, we can not even assume each study to have a `hadm_id`, since not every study was performed during an admission to the hospital. However, through the `hadm_id` we can retrieve the admission time and discharging time (`admittime` and `dischtime`) for each patient and each admission respectively. We can use these information to check for each study if it was conducted inbetween, since we have the `study_datetime` for each study. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each match we concatenate all the corresponding `long_title` values from `d_icd_diagnoses`, which serve as descriptions for the associated ontologies.  Lastly, we search in the descriptions for keywords indicating `Pneumonia`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the disease is not included in the extracted list of diagnoses, we set the label to 0. In particular, we don't overwrite existing certain positive labels from the `chexpert-labeler`, since it has a higher specificity than ICD based diagnoses.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the disease is included, we change the label to 1 only if other co-occurences are given (see `handle_missing_labels` in `src/datasets/preprocessing.py`). This is due to the fact, that we don't know at which time the patients have been diagnosed. At best the ICD ontology increases the likelihood of the disease. This can still lead to many false positives in our labels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining missing labels are mapped to `0`. For the remaining uncertain labels we try both binary mappings, to `0` and to `1`. "

    "Currently, we only have the radiology report available. This report is written by the radiologist *after* examining the X-Ray image of the patients. From the perspective of our classification task it doesn't make sense to include information generated by the radiologist, since this information is not available at the time we see the X-Ray image. \n",

    "The only exception is the indication section of a radiology report, which is written by the doctor, who ordered the X-Ray for the patient. To extract the indication sections, we first download all reports from Physionet. We then use a script from the [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code) to extract all indication sections. Please note that we use a [fork of the repository](https://github.com/mohkoh19/mimic-cxr), in which the `create_section_files.py` script has been modified to include the indication sections next to the impressions and findings sections.
